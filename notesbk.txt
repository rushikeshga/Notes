node architecture:
whenever we send any api request to node js server is goes to event queue of event loop. the event loop checks whether it is blocking session or non-blocking
session. if it is an non-blocking i.e. asynchronous operation node js will start processing that request. if it is an blocking session i.e. synchronous operation,
request goes to thread pool and thread is assign for that request and that thread starts processing that request. 
default thread pool size=4
